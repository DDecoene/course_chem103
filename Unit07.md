**Unit 7: Alkynes** <span id="7"></span> 
*In this unit, you will learn about alkynes, which are molecules
characterized by a triple carbon-carbon bond.  This particular bond
confers unique reactivity to alkynes, such as the capability of forming
stable salts with alkaline metal.*

This unit will take you 12 hours to complete.

**Unit7 Learning Outcomes**  
Upon successful completion of this unit, the student will be able to:  
  
-   Derive the name of alkynes from their molecular structure and vice
    versa. 
-   Estimate the acidity (pKa) of terminal alkynes.
-   Describe typical alkyne synthesis and reactions, especially the
    mechanism of synthesis by elimination and electrophilic addition
    reactions to the carbon-carbon triple bond.
