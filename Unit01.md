**Unit 1: Fundamentals of Organic Chemistry: Chemical Bonding,
Intermolecular Forces, and Acids & Bases** <span id="1"></span> 
*This unit introduces organic chemistry.  We will start by examining the
critical concept of chemical bonds.  All bonds are not the same.  In
fact, according to valence bond theory, many bonds are actually a mix of
different atomic orbitals.  These bonds are called “hybridized”
orbitals; they have different properties and bond angles.  Molecular
orbital (MO) theory uses the mathematical combinations of atomic
orbitals to create molecular orbitals.  You will notice that most
explanations throughout the course use valence bond theory.  Several
important concepts necessary to understanding organic chemistry arise
from chemical bonding, including chemical structures, molecular shapes
and geometries, polarity of chemical bonds (this concept will prove very
useful in understanding chemical reactivity later in the course),
resonance (later, resonance will explain why a reaction occurs in the
manner in which it does), and intermolecular force. *  
  
 *This unit will also review reaction energetics and will teach you how
to draw organic molecules and use "arrow notation" to show movements of
electrons.  It will also cover the concept of isomerism.  We will finish
up with a discussion of acids and bases within the context of the
course.  *

     Instructions: Read the tutorial webpage, and complete the practice
    problems.  Note that in organic chemistry, acids and bases are
    described as electron donors (Lewis bases) and electron acceptors
    (Lewis acids).  In subsequent units, Lewis acids and bases are
    linked to electrophiles and nucleophiles (these two concepts will be
    explained in subunit 2.4).
