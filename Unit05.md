**Unit 5: Alcohols** <span id="5"></span> 
*Alcohols are characterized by the presence of a hydroxyl group bound to
a carbon (C-OH) in the molecular structure.  This is the first family of
organic molecules with strong intramolecular forces (hydrogen bonds) you
have encountered so far.  Most of the alcohols' physical properties are
determined by these forces, such as their relatively high boiling point
and high solubility in water.  Simple alcohols are produced in
industrial quantities because they find applications in the food and
beverage industry (ethanol), cosmetics (ethanol, and isopropanol),
antifreezes and cooling systems (methanol), cleaning products, and, more
recently, gasoline (where ethanol and butanol are used as additives). 
In this unit, you will learn how to name and synthesize alcohols.  You
will also read about alcohol’s most common reactions and learn how to
use these reactions to convert alcohols into more valuable products. *
