**Unit 2: Overview of Organic Chemistry: Functional Groups and Classes
of Chemical Reactions** <span id="2"></span> 
*Here you will learn the basic concepts necessary to understanding the
rest of the course.  Each of these concepts will be mastered in the
appropriate units ahead, but a general overview is necessary at this
point. *  
  
 *In this unit, you will learn how to classify organic molecules based
on their functional group(s).  A functional group is a group of atoms
that presents characteristic physical and chemical properties, such as
chemical reactivity or spectroscopy behavior.  You will also learn how
to use arrow notation to indicate movements of electrons in organic
reactions.  The unit will conclude with an introduction to organic
reactions and an explanation of how to classify a reaction based on a
particular technique or reagent.*

**Unit 2 Time Advisory**  
This unit will take approximately 15 hours to complete.  
  
 ☐    Subunit 2.1: 5 hours  
  
 ☐    Subunit 2.2: 3 hours  
  
 ☐    Subunit 2.3: 3 hours  
  
 ☐    Subunit 2.4: 4 hours

**Unit2 Learning Outcomes**  
Upon successful completion of this unit, the student will be able to:  
  
-   Identify various organic functional groups and assign a particular
    molecule to the family of organic compound to which it belongs.
-   Use curve arrow notation to show movements of electrons.
-   Describe—in general terms—organic reactions.
-   Give the definition of “basicity,” "nucleophile," and
    "electrophile."
