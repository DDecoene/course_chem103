**Unit 6: Alkenes** <span id="6"></span> 
*Alkenes are hydrocarbons with carbon-carbon double bonds.  Alkenes are
also known as ‘olefins’ which means ‘oil forming gas’.  Many important
alkenes are found in plants and animals as well as in industrial
compounds. ‘Ethylene’, for example, is the largest-volume organic
compound produced.  The alkene reactions you will learn about here will
serve as the basis for understanding the more complex reactions you will
encounter later in the course and in more advanced courses, such as
pharmaceutical and medicinal chemistry.  You should make sure you
understand the rationale and mechanisms behind the reactions listed
prior to moving on, as they are extremely important!*

**Unit6 Learning Outcomes**  
Upon successful completion of this unit, the student will be able to:  
  
-   Derive the name of alkenes from their molecular structure and vice
    versa. 
-   Understand the difference between *cis* and *tran* isomers.
-   Draw conformational isomers and assign the proper notation (E/Z,
    etc.).
-   Calculate the degree of unsaturation.
-   Describe alkene synthesis from alcohols and typical reactions with
    an emphasis on the reaction mechanism for the addition of
    electrophilic reagents to the carbon-carbon double bond.
