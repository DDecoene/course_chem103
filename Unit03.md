**Unit 3: Alkanes** <span id="3"></span> 
*We will now transition into looking at each family of organic
molecules, noting their respective properties and reactivity.  All units
covering functional groups are structured into two main parts: 1)
Nomenclature, Structural, and Physical Properties; and 2) Reactivity. 
In the first section, we will study molecular nomenclature, or the
systematic naming of molecules as defined by the International Union of
Pure and Applied Chemistry (IUPAC).  In many ways, organic chemistry is
analogous to learning a foreign language.  We must learn how to describe
structures in the language that organic chemists use.*  
  
 *We will start with the simplest hydrocarbons: the alkanes.  Alkanes
are hydrocarbons with only carbon and hydrogens.  In addition to
nomenclature and properties, this unit will cover the concept of
isomerism in detail.  Isomerism is the study of many different
structures that molecules with same chemical formula can have.  The unit
will conclude with a section on the reactivity of alkanes.  Alkanes are
often described as non-reactive, inert, or low-reactive compounds. 
However, under drastic conditions, these molecules can react and yield
many of the molecules and materials we encounter in our daily life,
including the major components in gasoline.*

     Instructions: Read the sections linked above.  In the previous
    unit, we learned about the different conformations an alkane can
    assume upon free rotation along a carbon-carbon bond.  In
    cycloalkanes, this free rotation is not permitted as atoms are
    "locked" in a ring structure.  These rings are not as rigid as they
    might appear.  In fact, cycloalkanes often undergo "ring flip."  In
    this section, you will learn about this flipping phenomena, the
    stable configuration of cycloalkanes (called "chair"), the less
    stable one (called "boat"), and the energy barrier to be overcome
    for ring flipping.
